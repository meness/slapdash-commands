## Getting Started

### Requirements

#### Slapdash

To test and run your commands, you should have [Slapdash](https://slapdash.com/) installed.

## Installation

Install and use this package as easy as running this command.

```sh
npm install slapdash-commands
```

## Usage

This is our recommended directory structure.

```
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-command/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ first.ts
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ second.ts
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ third.ts
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ args.ts
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ command.ts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
```

### pages

Each move action is called a page here. A move action changes the location of the Command Bar. We recommend you follow this structure to make your code understandable and testable.

### args.ts

This is optional, but creating an interface of the command's arguments helps you with linting and auto-completion.

```typescript
interface Arguments {
  firstArg?: string;
  secondArg?: string;
  // ...
}
```

### command.ts

Start writing your own command from here.

```typescript
slapdash((args: Arguments) => {
  // Use the pages, from last to first
  if (args.secondArg !== undefined) {
    return thirdPage(args.secondArg);
  } else if (args.firstArg !== undefined) {
    return secondPage(args.firstArg);
  }

  return firstPage();
});
```
